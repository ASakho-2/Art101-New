    <h2>REVIEW</h2>
    <p class="special"> I say fairly resounding because, in truth, the story is much slimmer and I can't say the music
        is
        very memorable. But the animation by which it stands or falls is as brilliant as ever and, though it wouldn't
        really be
        right to call it totally anti-Disney, it certainly trumps that institution for sharpness of focus, notably as
        far as the
        screenplay is concerned. Considering Shrek 2 has been given a U certificate, it takes a few of the kind of risks
        that old
        Walt would never have countenanced. It's a bit of a mickey-take, particularly of celebrity, that might just go a
        bit
        above a few kids' heads, even though they may well giggle at a Pinocchio in ladies' underwear.</p>

            <p class="special">
                Prince Charming: Once upon a time in a kingdom far far away, the king and queen were blessed with a
                beautiful baby girl.
                And throughout the land, everyone was happy. Until the sun went down, and they saw that their daughter
                was cursed with a
                frightful enchantment that took hold each and every night. Desperate, they sought the help of a fairy
                godmother;
                who had them lock the young princess away in a tower, there to await the kiss of the handsome Prince
                Charming!</p>

            [Prince Charming arrives at the Dragon's Keep, an ominous castle surrounded by a moat of lava, but sees that
            the wooden
            bridge leading across the lava was destroyed by the Dragon from the first movie. Charming uses his bow to
            shoot a roped
            arrow to a wooden post on the other side and uses it as a zipline. He looks up at a tower that rises above
            the rest of
            the castle, a light shining from its window. He enters the Dragon's Keep]
